### Binomial Model
Binomial model is arguably the simplest techniques used for option pricing. In this calculator, the options price will be calculated by two binomial-tree methods,Cox-Ross-Rubinstein and Jarrow-Rudd (the equal-probability model). 

Each of the approaches has its advantages and disadvantages for pricing different types of options. However, they all involve a similar tree-step process.

* There are only two possible prices for the underlying asset on the next day.
* The two possible prices are the up-price and down-price
* No dividends are paid out during the optionâ€™s life.
* The risk-free rate is constant throughout the life of the option
* There are no transaction and commissions costs in buying the option.
* Investors are risk neutral

#### ** All trees are built from four parameters (u, d, p and q). 
- The parameters u and d are how much the underlying will go up or down in each discrete time. 
- The parameters p and q are the probabilities for the price to go up and down respectively. Moreover, assume p+q=1.
